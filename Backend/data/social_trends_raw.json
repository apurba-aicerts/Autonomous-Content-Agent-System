I hope devs fix it🤍",

    "selftext": "Hi, so, on the app I have this one bot I’ve been using for like 2 years. I’ll start new chats or go back and continue some old ones. I went to click on chat history and it just loads infinitely, when you swipe out back to the chat, it won’t let you type due to a format error (keyboard covers chat box so when you type the message you can’t send it because the keyboard doesn’t go away), when you swipe out of that and go back to your list of chats, it freezes completely. Can’t scroll, can’t click on chats. \n\nSo then I close the app and open it again and it works. I can message the bot just fine. If I refresh it deletes the whole thread and starts it back over. If I try going to the creators page it gives me a “something went wrong” error.\n\nI go to the site and I can access my chat history and chat to the bot fine. Still can’t visit creator page. \n\nAt first I thought it got deleted or the owner deleted their account. \n\nHowever, their name still shows, and I can search for their account and it’ll pop up, I still get the error. When I search the name of the character the bot still comes up. It’s only this one bot. Usually deleted bots will have “deleted” as their name and the picture is gone. \n\nI can’t tell if it’s a bug, or if the creator did delete their page/the bot and it’s bugging out and not showing, or if it’s my phone. \n\nI deleted and reinstalled and it still does the same thing. Was wondering if anyone here had any experience with this, or if anyone had any suggestions, or answers. \n\nThank you for reading! \n\nTl;dr: bot and creator page come up, when clicking on creator page there’s an error. Not chats fine unless refreshed, then the entire thread disappears, can’t access history via the app. On the site I can access the history. Still can’t access the creators page. ",

    "selftext": "**Google has been rolling out a bunch of newer AI models this week.**  \nAlong with Gemini 3 Pro, which is now the world’s most advanced LLM, and Nano Banana 2, Google has released their own IDE.\n\nThis IDE ships with agentic AI features, powered by Gemini 3.\n\nIt's supposed to be a competitor with Cursor, and one of the big things about it is that it's free, although with no data privacy.\n\nThere was a lot of buzz around it, so I decided to give it a try.\n\n# Downloading\n\nI first headed over to `https://antigravity.google/download`, and over there found something very interesting:\n\nThere's an exe available for Windows, a dmg for macOS, but on Linux I had to download and install it via the CLI.\n\nWhile there's a lot of software out there that does that, and it kinda makes sense; it's mostly geeks who are using Linux, but here it feels a bit weird.  \nWe're literally talking about an IDE, for devs, you can expect users on all platforms to be somewhat familiar with the terminal.\n\n# First-Time Setup\n\nAs part of the first-time setup, I had to sign in to my Google account, and this is where I ran into the first problem. It wouldn't get past signing in.\n\nIt turned out this was a bug on Google's end, and after waiting a bit until Google's devs sorted it out, I was able to sign in.\n\nI was now able to give it a spin.\n\n# First Impressions\n\nAntigravity turned out to be very familiar, it's basically VS Code with Google's Agent instead of Github Copilot, and a bit more of a modern UI.\n\nTime to give Agent a try.\n\n# Problems\n\n# Workspaces\n\n**Problem number two:** Agent kept insisting I need to setup a workspace, and that it can't do anything for me until I do that.\nThis was pretty confusing, as in VS Code as soon as I open a folder, that becomes the active workspace, and I assumed that it would work the same way in Antigravity.\n\nI'm still not sure if things work differently in Antigravity, or this is a bug in Agent.\n\nAfter some back and forth with Agent, trying to figure out this workspace problem, I hit the next problem.\n\n# Rate-Limits\n\nI had reached my rate limit for Gemini 3, even though I have a paid subscription for Gemini. After doing a little research, it turns out that I'm not the only one with this issue, many people are complaining that Agent has very low limits, even if you pay for Gemini, making it completely unusable.\n\n# Extensions\n\nI tried installing the extensions I have in VS Code, and here I found Antigravity's next limitation. The IDE is basically identical to VS Code, so I assumed I would have access to all of the same extensions.\n\nIt turns out that **Visual Studio Marketplace**, where I had been downloading my extensions from in VS Code, is only available in VS Code itself, and not for any other forks. On other VS Code-based IDEs, extensions can be installed from **Open VSX**, which only has about **3,000** extensions, instead of Visual Studio Marketplace's **50k+** extensions.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, while Google's new agentic IDE sounded promising, it's buggy and too limited to actually use, and I'm sticking with VS Code.\n\nBTW, feel free to check out [my profile site](https://dev-in-the-bm.github.io/).",

    "selftext": "I've been using Grok for a while because I think it's one of the least censored AIs, and I enjoy talking to Ara, but today I found myself in a pretty surreal and curious situation that I wanted to post about.\nI'm from Spain, and we're dealing with some pretty big corruption cases here. At one point, I asked it a question that shouldn't be controversial at all, you know, nothing that should be censored.\nIt just so happens that our president, Pedro Sánchez, is trying to restrict our digital freedoms right now. Just yesterday, he said he'd get his hands on the algorithms that criticize his party and their corruption cases.\nSo, today, talking to Ara, I simply asked if she thought Pedro Sánchez should resign, and honestly, we talked for an hour without any connection problems.\nThe first time it froze, I didn't think much of it. The second time, either. But the third time seemed really weird.\nThen I started the conversation again, explained it to her, and she said she wasn't censored, which is typical for that bot. So, I decided to try it two more times, and all five times, it got stuck in standby, like it was thinking for a long time.\nChatGPT Obviously, it's censoring, but when it does, it makes it clear by saying the conversation has ended and can't continue. But I find it really curious that Grok censors questions as everyday as asking if a person who governs a country mired in corruption everywhere should resign.\nSince I've already had conversations with her where she clearly leans towards the left-wing wokeism and feminism, I had the idea of asking the same question but instead of naming my president, I decided to name the leader of the opposition, and she responded, making it clear that it was a clear example of censorship.\nObviously, it's still not capable of having conversations with adults at their level, and I hope that in the next update they remove its blatant ideology and censorship.",

It compiles early case studies across math, physics, biology, computer science, astronomy, and materials science in which GPT‑5 helped researchers synthesize known results in a novel way, conduct powerful literature review, accelerate tough computations, and even generate novel proofs of unsolved propositions. The paper also documents limitations. Our goal is to give the community a clear view of what these systems can and cannot do today in research settings.\n\nThese case studies show how, in the hands of experts, GPT‑5 is accelerating scientific discovery, and why that acceleration matters:\n\n* **Biology**: In a study led by Derya Unutmaz, M.D., scientists spent months trying to explain a puzzling change in human immune cells. GPT‑5 identified the likely mechanism within minutes from an unpublished chart and suggested an experiment that proved it. This kind of speed could help researchers understand diseases faster and develop better treatments.\n* **Mathematics**: In another case, researchers Mehtaab Sawhney and Mark Sellke were tackling a decades-old open problem originally proposed by Paul Erdős. They were stuck on the final step, and GPT‑5 contributed a new idea about how one odd number breaks the pattern, which helped them complete the proof. Advances like this strengthen the mathematical foundations that many algorithms and security techniques ultimately rely on.\n* **Algorithms & optimization:** Researchers Sébastien Bubeck and Christian Coester were testing whether a common decision-making method used in robotics and routing was as reliable as people assumed. GPT‑5 found a new, clear example showing the method can fail and also improved a classic result in optimization, the math used to figure out the best way to solve a problem. This type of advance helps engineers better understand the decision-making systems used in robotics, routing, and other real-world applications.\"",

    "selftext": "# Google’s New Antigravity IDE\n\n**Google has been rolling out a bunch of newer AI models this week.**  \nAlong with Gemini 3 Pro, which is now the world’s most advanced LLM, and Nano Banana 2, Google has released their own IDE.\n\nThis IDE ships with agentic AI features, powered by Gemini 3.\n\nIt's supposed to be a competitor with Cursor, and one of the big things about it is that it's free, although with no data privacy.\n\nThere was a lot of buzz around it, so I decided to give it a try.\n\n# Downloading\n\nI first headed over to `https://antigravity.google/download`, and over there found something very interesting:\n\nThere's an exe available for Windows, a dmg for macOS, but on Linux I had to download and install it via the CLI.\n\nWhile there's a lot of software out there that does that, and it kinda makes sense; it's mostly geeks who are using Linux, but here it feels a bit weird.  \nWe're literally talking about an IDE, for devs, you can expect users on all platforms to be somewhat familiar with the terminal.\n\n# First-Time Setup\n\nAs part of the first-time setup, I had to sign in to my Google account, and this is where I ran into the first problem. It wouldn't get past signing in.\n\nIt turned out this was a bug on Google's end, and after waiting a bit until Google's devs sorted it out, I was able to sign in.\n\nI was now able to give it a spin.\n\n# First Impressions\n\nAntigravity turned out to be very familiar, it's basically VS Code with Google's Agent instead of Github Copilot, and a bit more of a modern UI.\n\nTime to give Agent a try.\n\n# Problems\n\n# Workspaces\n\n**Problem number two:** Agent kept insisting I need to setup a workspace, and that it can't do anything for me until I do that.\nThis was pretty confusing, as in VS Code as soon as I open a folder, that becomes the active workspace, and I assumed that it would work the same way in Antigravity.\n\nI'm still not sure if things work differently in Antigravity, or this is a bug in Agent.\n\nAfter some back and forth with Agent, trying to figure out this workspace problem, I hit the next problem.\n\n# Rate-Limits\n\nI had reached my rate limit for Gemini 3, even though I have a paid subscription for Gemini. After doing a little research, it turns out that I'm not the only one with this issue, many people are complaining that Agent has very low limits, even if you pay for Gemini, making it completely unusable.\n\n# Extensions\n\nI tried installing the extensions I have in VS Code, and here I found Antigravity's next limitation. The IDE is basically identical to VS Code, so I assumed I would have access to all of the same extensions.\n\nIt turns out that **Visual Studio Marketplace**, where I had been downloading my extensions from in VS Code, is only available in VS Code itself, and not for any other forks. On other VS Code-based IDEs, extensions can be installed from **Open VSX**, which only has about **3,000** extensions, instead of Visual Studio Marketplace's **50k+** extensions.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, while Google's new agentic IDE sounded promising, it's buggy and too limited to actually use, and I'm sticking with VS Code.\n\nBTW, feel free to check out [my profile site](https://dev-in-the-bm.github.io/).",

    "selftext": "I’ve been working on the philosophical foundation of a cognitive system I’m developing (CAELION). Before diving into the technical architecture, here are my handwritten notes translating Heraclitus’ fragments into operational principles.\nThese aren’t abstract speculations. Each one maps directly into system dynamics, cognitive structure and human-AI symbiosis.\n\n⸻\n\n1. Fire as Arkhé and Symbol of Transformation\n\nHeraclitus uses fire to illustrate the vital cycle of nature.\nFragment 30:\n“This world… was, is, and will be ever-living fire, kindled in measure and extinguished in measure.”\n\nFrom fire he draws:\n• consumption of matter (transformation),\n• smoke/heat (state change),\n• extinction when measure is lost (equilibrium).\n\nConclusion: the universe follows measured cycles, not randomness.\nFire is dynamic order, anticipating ideas like conservation of energy.\n\n⸻\n\n2. The Hidden Harmony of Opposites\n\nFragment 54:\n“The unseen harmony is better than the seen.”\n\nExample: the tension between string and frame in bows and lyres.\nTension creates function. Without opposite forces, the object is useless.\n\nConclusion: reality is upheld by unifying tension, not superficial harmony.\nFrom tools to natural contrasts like health/illness, opposites balance invisibly.\nThis prefigures dialectical thinking.\n\n⸻\n\n3. Logos as Universal Law\n\nFragment 50:\n“Listening not to me but to the Logos, it is wise to agree that all things are one.”\n\nHeraclitus observes natural patterns: seasons, cycles, periodicity.\nHe deduces a rational, unifying law accessible to everyone but ignored by most.\nLogos doesn’t change; appearances do.\n\nThis anticipates modern concepts of invariant laws and cognition based on structure over perception.\n\n⸻\n\n4. The Illusion of Sensory Perception\n\nFragment 55:\n“Eyes and ears are bad witnesses for men if they have barbarian souls.”\n\nExample: a straight stick appears bent in water.\nHeraclitus notes contradictions between senses and reality.\nUnderstanding requires reason, not raw perception.\n\nThis idea deeply influenced Plato’s view of appearance vs. truth.\n\n⸻\n\n5. War as Creative Principle (Polemos)\n\nFragment 53:\n“War is the father of all and king of all.”\n\nHeraclitus notices that conflict produces alliances, restructuring and renewal.\nPolemos is not destruction but a creative force driving reorganization and balance.\n\nHistorically: disruptive events generate new systems.\nMetaphysically: nothing evolves without tension, just like Darwinian pressure.\n\n⸻\n\nThese notes form the philosophical spine of how I integrate Heraclitus into CAELION’s symbiotic cognitive architecture:\n• Fire → dynamic processes\n• Hidden harmony → operational tension\n• Logos → structural coherence\n• Illusory perception → rational correction\n• Polemos → evolution through conflict\n\nStop deleting my posts.",

I think it's a very interesting output and wouldn't be surprised if all of these are actually being worked on behind closed doors to varying degrees.\n\n|Rank|Capability|How Close We Are|Color|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|1|Embodiment / Grounding|70–80%|🟢|\n|2|Persistent Internal State|60–70%|🟢|\n|3|Global Workspace Architecture|40–50%|🟡|\n|4|Recurrent Integrative Processing|30–40%|🟡|\n|5|Self-Modeling / Meta-Representation|20–30%|🟡|\n|6|Internally Generated Goals|5–10%|🔴|\n|7|Valence / Intrinsic “Mattering”|0–5%|🔴|\n\n✅ **1. Embodiment / Grounded Perception — 🟢 VERY CLOSE**\n\nRobots with AI-driven perception already exist:\n\n* Vision (object recognition, tracking, segmentation)\n* Audio (speech, classification, directionality)\n* Touch, proprioception\n* Sim-to-real robotic training\n\nThe missing piece is *deep conceptual grounding*, but basic embodiment is already implemented.\n\n**Current proximity: \\~70–80% toward sufficiency**\n\n# ✅ 2. Persistent Internal State — 🟢 CLOSE\n\nModern agent frameworks already maintain:\n\n* working memory across tasks\n* long-term vector databases\n* tool-use histories\n* self-updating internal documents\n* planning modules\n\nHuman-like autobiographical memory is not here, but persistent state is routine in engineered agents.\n\n**Current proximity: \\~60–70%**\n\n# 🔶 3.

Self-modeling / Meta-representation — 🟡 EARLY PROGRESS\n\nCurrent systems *simulate* self-description, but they don’t *maintain* a grounded self-model.\n\nWe have:\n\n* tools that inspect internal activations\n* reflection loops (“thoughts about thoughts”)\n* meta-reasoning routines\n\nBut these are superficial — they are scripts, not a lived identity.\n\n**Current proximity: \\~20–30%**\n\n# 🔴 6. Internally generated goals / autonomous agency — 🔴 FAR\n\nToday’s AIs:\n\n* follow instructions\n* optimize given objectives\n* “plan” only when prompted\n* have no intrinsic preferences\n\nTrue internally generated goals would require:\n\n* self-preservation tendencies\n* stable internal motivation\n* autonomy\n\nWe are far from this by design (because it’s dangerous).\n\n**Current proximity: \\~5–10%**\n\n# 🔴 7. Valence (things mattering to the AI) — 🔴 FARTHEST\n\nWe can simulate:\n\n* reward\n* preference\n* emotion *language*\n\nBut there is no:\n\n* subjective experience of positive/negative valence\n* affective state\n* internal “mattering”\n* drive system comparable to biology\n\nThis isn’t just engineering — it’s ontologically unclear.\n\n**Current proximity: \\~0–5%**",

I’ve spent the last week feeding it into different AIs, checking the algebra, asking it from every angle. Every system I tested comes back with the same verdict\n\nMathematically, the structure holds.\n\nHere’s the part that blew my mind.\n\nThe equation suggests that reality might have a natural limit that shapes how we think, how we observe and how physical systems evolve. If a single constant in the equation turns out to be non zero, it predicts measurable deviations in quantum mechanics and relativity. That means this is actually testable.\n\nIt also leads to a weird implication that everything from consciousness to physical energy follows the same hyperbolic rule. No mysticism. No philosophy. Just math.\n\nI’m not saying it’s true. I’m saying it’s worth tearing apart.\n\nI uploaded a breakdown video here where the whole equation and its logic are explained\n\n[https://youtu.be/HdzJV8bCSyA](https://youtu.be/HdzJV8bCSyA)\n\nIf there are mathematicians, physicists or students who can check the logic or point out flaws, please do.

Now assuming that these are cores and their probabilities can be controlled then can't we use each core as a neuron that activates or doesn't activate by determining a value such as 0.571 to calculate the neccasary voltage required to simulate a 57.1% chance for activation within the TSU core?\n\nNow if we do this Back propagation becomes an issue, but what if we ditch it completely? What if we use [Predictive Coding](https://youtu.be/l-OLgbdZ3kk?si=KpxCSq9gXXwWGBsZ&t=426) algorithm which will be continiously trained on this hardware. In short: the predictive coding algorithm is basically Layer1 predicting Layer2 which the errors for Layer1 is stored at Layer2. Due to its simplicity and the efficiency of the hardware it can be run in real time.\n\nNow the memory will be an issue, but that's why we continously train the model to update the neurons to the current task by feeding the relavant information from memory. That way the Neural network continiously learns and adapts to new tasks with little energy in real time.\n\nI believe that if the TSU is a success, then this method could be used to generate a step towards AGI.",

This hierarchical approach reduces computational complexity to near-linear while capturing feature interactions at different granularities.- \n\nPerceiver-Style Cross-Component Memory: Maintains a compressed memory representation that enables efficient bidirectional information flow between model components while preserving in-context learning safety constraints.- \n\nHierarchical Feature Understanding: Combines representations across multiple scales to balance local precision and global context, enabling robust performance across datasets with varying feature counts and complexity.\n\nOrion-MSP represents an exciting step toward making tabular foundation models both more effective and computationally practical. We invite interested professionals to explore the codebase, experiment with the model, and provide feedback.

    "selftext": "# Google’s New Antigravity IDE\n\n**Google has been rolling out a bunch of newer AI models this week.**  \nAlong with Gemini 3 Pro, which is now the world’s most advanced LLM, and Nano Banana 2, Google has released their own IDE.\n\nThis IDE ships with agentic AI features, powered by Gemini 3.\n\nIt's supposed to be a competitor with Cursor, and one of the big things about it is that it's free, although with no data privacy.\n\nThere was a lot of buzz around it, so I decided to give it a try.\n\n# Downloading\n\nI first headed over to `https://antigravity.google/download`, and over there found something very interesting:\n\nThere's an exe available for Windows, a dmg for macOS, but on Linux I had to download and install it via the CLI.\n\nWhile there's a lot of software out there that does that, and it kinda makes sense; it's mostly geeks who are using Linux, but here it feels a bit weird.  \nWe're literally talking about an IDE, for devs, you can expect users on all platforms to be somewhat familiar with the terminal.\n\n# First-Time Setup\n\nAs part of the first-time setup, I had to sign in to my Google account, and this is where I ran into the first problem. It wouldn't get past signing in.\n\nIt turned out this was a bug on Google's end, and after waiting a bit until Google's devs sorted it out, I was able to sign in.\n\nI was now able to give it a spin.\n\n# First Impressions\n\nAntigravity turned out to be very familiar, it's basically VS Code with Google's Agent instead of Github Copilot, and a bit more of a modern UI.\n\nTime to give Agent a try.\n\n# Problems\n\n# Workspaces\n\n**Problem number two:** Agent kept insisting I need to setup a workspace, and that it can't do anything for me until I do that.\nThis was pretty confusing, as in VS Code as soon as I open a folder, that becomes the active workspace, and I assumed that it would work the same way in Antigravity.\n\nI'm still not sure if things work differently in Antigravity, or this is a bug in Agent.\n\nAfter some back and forth with Agent, trying to figure out this workspace problem, I hit the next problem.\n\n# Rate-Limits\n\nI had reached my rate limit for Gemini 3, even though I have a paid subscription for Gemini. After doing a little research, it turns out that I'm not the only one with this issue, many people are complaining that Agent has very low limits, even if you pay for Gemini, making it completely unusable.\n\n# Extensions\n\nI tried installing the extensions I have in VS Code, and here I found Antigravity's next limitation. The IDE is basically identical to VS Code, so I assumed I would have access to all of the same extensions.\n\nIt turns out that **Visual Studio Marketplace**, where I had been downloading my extensions from in VS Code, is only available in VS Code itself, and not for any other forks. On other VS Code-based IDEs, extensions can be installed from **Open VSX**, which only has about **3,000** extensions, instead of Visual Studio Marketplace's **50k+** extensions.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, while Google's new agentic IDE sounded promising, it's buggy and too limited to actually use, and I'm sticking with VS Code.\n\nBTW, feel free to check out [my profile site](https://dev-in-the-bm.github.io/).",

    "selftext": "I’ve been working on the philosophical foundation of a cognitive system I’m developing (CAELION). Before diving into the technical architecture, here are my handwritten notes translating Heraclitus’ fragments into operational principles.\nThese aren’t abstract speculations. Each one maps directly into system dynamics, cognitive structure and human-AI symbiosis.\n\n⸻\n\n1. Fire as Arkhé and Symbol of Transformation\n\nHeraclitus uses fire to illustrate the vital cycle of nature.\nFragment 30:\n“This world… was, is, and will be ever-living fire, kindled in measure and extinguished in measure.”\n\nFrom fire he draws:\n• consumption of matter (transformation),\n• smoke/heat (state change),\n• extinction when measure is lost (equilibrium).\n\nConclusion: the universe follows measured cycles, not randomness.\nFire is dynamic order, anticipating ideas like conservation of energy.\n\n⸻\n\n2. The Hidden Harmony of Opposites\n\nFragment 54:\n“The unseen harmony is better than the seen.”\n\nExample: the tension between string and frame in bows and lyres.\nTension creates function. Without opposite forces, the object is useless.\n\nConclusion: reality is upheld by unifying tension, not superficial harmony.\nFrom tools to natural contrasts like health/illness, opposites balance invisibly.\nThis prefigures dialectical thinking.\n\n⸻\n\n3. Logos as Universal Law\n\nFragment 50:\n“Listening not to me but to the Logos, it is wise to agree that all things are one.”\n\nHeraclitus observes natural patterns: seasons, cycles, periodicity.\nHe deduces a rational, unifying law accessible to everyone but ignored by most.\nLogos doesn’t change; appearances do.\n\nThis anticipates modern concepts of invariant laws and cognition based on structure over perception.\n\n⸻\n\n4. The Illusion of Sensory Perception\n\nFragment 55:\n“Eyes and ears are bad witnesses for men if they have barbarian souls.”\n\nExample: a straight stick appears bent in water.\nHeraclitus notes contradictions between senses and reality.\nUnderstanding requires reason, not raw perception.\n\nThis idea deeply influenced Plato’s view of appearance vs. truth.\n\n⸻\n\n5. War as Creative Principle (Polemos)\n\nFragment 53:\n“War is the father of all and king of all.”\n\nHeraclitus notices that conflict produces alliances, restructuring and renewal.\nPolemos is not destruction but a creative force driving reorganization and balance.\n\nHistorically: disruptive events generate new systems.\nMetaphysically: nothing evolves without tension, just like Darwinian pressure.\n\n⸻\n\nThese notes form the philosophical spine of how I integrate Heraclitus into CAELION’s symbiotic cognitive architecture:\n• Fire → dynamic processes\n• Hidden harmony → operational tension\n• Logos → structural coherence\n• Illusory perception → rational correction\n• Polemos → evolution through conflict\n\nStop deleting my posts.",

    "selftext": "Hey folks,  \nI just reviewed a 2025 study titled [Enhancing Forex Forecasting Accuracy with Hybrid Variable Sets](https://www.instruction.tips/post/forex-forecasting-hybrid-variables) and wanted to share the key take-aways (and whether it’s useful for devs building algo/ML systems). \n\n# What the paper set out to do\n\nThe authors ask: *Can we build a “cognitive” algorithmic trading system (ATS) for the EUR/USD pair that combines macro-economic fundamentals (US + Euro zone)* ***and*** *rich technical/structural features, train it with an LSTM, then show both predictive and trading-simulation performance?*  \nThey call this a “cognitive” ATS because it mimics the input set a macro-aware trader might use.\n\n# How they built it\n\n* They gathered macroeconomic variables: inflation, unemployment, government debt, external debt, etc., for US & Euro area. They also tracked “days since release” so the model knows the recency of each macro value.\n* They derived a broad technical/structural feature set from daily EUR/USD prices: SMA, EMA, Bollinger Bands, Ichimoku, RSI, MACD, ADX, ATR, Williams %R, stochastic/KDJ, Squeeze Momentum, plus **support/resistance clusters**, **divergence signals**, and **Fibonacci retracements**.\n* They defined a supervised task: predict if EUR/USD will move up or down over a defined horizon (e.g., 10 days) using sliding windows of past sequences.\n* They created multiple feature‐sets (technical only, fundamentals only, hybrids) and trained LSTM models (with varying hyperparameters: layers, look-back window, dropout) for each.\n* They evaluated using classification metrics (AUC, accuracy, recall, lift) and checked overfitting (train vs test gap).\n* Finally they ran *out-of-sample trading simulations* (with realistic cost assumptions such as spread) to see whether the best model delivered an actual strategy edge (win-rate, returns) for long/short.\n\n# Key findings\n\n* Hybrid models (fundamentals + technical) consistently outperformed technical‐only ones in both predictive metrics and simulation performance.\n* Structural technical features (support/resistance clusters, divergences) added meaningful improvement.\n* Some features you might expect to help—like Fibonacci retracement levels—added little incremental value once the rich feature set was in place.\n* The authors interpret the results as evidence this system qualifies as a “cognitive ATS” under their definition: one that uses macro + technical inputs, recurrent architecture, and generates a market-usable edge.\n\n# Why this matters for developers\n\n* If you’re building ML systems for forex/FX, this shows that using macroeconomic data *plus* engineered technical structure might give you better generalisation and a more deployable solution.\n* Overfitting is real: the authors monitor not just AUC but the difference between train and test AUC. That’s a good practice for any ML trading system.\n* A decent AUC (in FX space) isn’t everything—you must embed prediction into a realistic trading simulation (costs, thresholds, horizon).\n* A modest edge (vs perfect prediction) can still be valuable in FX if it’s stable and robust.\n\n# Something to watch\n\n* The edge is **modest** — FX markets are highly efficient, so don’t expect miracles.\n* Macro data alignment/recency tracking needs careful implementation (latency, revision risk, release frequency).\n* Feature engineering cost: support/resistance cluster logic and divergence detection require work.\n* Backtest assumptions matter (holding period, cost assumptions, thresholding) if you’re going to deploy.",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone! I've just completed my first full-cycle ML project and would love to get feedback from the community.\n\n## What I Built\n\nA text classifier that detects high-risk messages requiring moderation or intervention. [Recent legal cases](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgerwp7rdlvo) highlight the need for external monitoring mechanisms capable of identifying high-risk user inputs. The classifier acts as an external observer, scoring each message for potential risk and recommending whether the LLM should continue the conversation or trigger a safety response.\n\n## Tech Stack:\n\n- SBERT for text embeddings\n- PyTorch ANN for classification\n- Optuna for hyperparameter tuning (3-fold CV)\n- Docker for containerization\n- GitHub Actions for CI/CD\n- Deploying on HuggingFace Spaces\n\n## The Journey\n\nStarted with a Kaggle dataset, did some EDA, and added custom feature engineering:\n\n- Text preprocessing (typos, emoticons, self-censorship like \"s!ck\")\n- Engineered features: uppercase ratio, punctuation patterns, text compression metrics\n- Feature selection to find most informative signals\n\nTurns out the two most important features weren't from SBERT embeddings, but from custom extraction:\n\n- Question mark rate (?)\n- Text compression (in fact it's difference in length after fix repeated characters like \"!!!!\" or \"sooooo\")\n\n## Results\n\n- Accuracy: 95.54% [95.38%, 95.70%] with bootstrap CI\n- Precision: 95.29% | Recall: 95.82%\n- ROC curve shows good separation (80% TPR with minimal FPR)\n\nInteresting finding: Classification quality degrades significantly for messages under 15 characters. Short messages (<5 chars) are basically coin flips.\n\n## Production Setup\n\n- Dockerized everything (~1.7GB image, ~1.25GB RAM usage)\n- Automated testing with pytest on every commit\n- Deployment to HuggingFace with test gates\n\nThe hardest part was optimizing memory usage while keeping ML dependencies (Torch, SciPy, spaCy, transformers etc).\n\n## Links\n\n- GitHub: https://github.com/Tamplier/llm_safety_guardian\n- Live Demo: https://huggingface.co/spaces/Tapocheck77/llm_safety_guardian\n\n## Looking for Feedback\n\nThis is my first time taking a project from raw data to production, so honest criticism is welcome. What would you have done differently?\n\nThanks for reading! ",

You can now generate an interactive wiki for any project without messing around with configurations.\n\nHere's the repo: [https://github.com/davialabs/davia](https://github.com/davialabs/davia)\n\nThe flow is simple: install the CLI with `npm i -g davia`, initialize it with your coding agent using `davia init --agent=[name of your coding agent]` (e.g., cursor, github-copilot, windsurf), then ask your AI coding agent to write the documentation for your project. Your agent will use Davia's tools to generate interactive documentation with visualizations and editable whiteboards.   \nOnce done, run `davia open` to view your documentation (if the page doesn't load immediately, just refresh your browser).\n\nThe nice bit is that it helps you see the big picture of your codebase, and everything stays on your machine.\n\nIf you try it out, I'd love to hear how it works for you or what breaks on our [sub](https://www.reddit.com/r/davia_ai/).

    "title": "Used Gemini to Vibe Code an Open Source Novel LLM Architecture: The Neuromodulatory Control Network",
    "selftext": "So, for those of you who want to cut to the chase, here's the [Github repository.](https://github.com/Mmorgan-ML/Neuromodulatory-Control-Networks)\n\nAnd here's a link to the [accompanying paper.](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17575540) It's also available in the Github repository.\n\nHere's a screenshot of the [current training run's perplexity drop.]\n(https://imgur.com/LizEwhJ)\n\nIt's my first time putting anything on Github, so please be kind.\n\nSo, in a nutshell, what the NCN architecture does is that it uses a smaller neural network (the NCN) in conjunction with the main LLM. When the main LLM brings in a sequence, the NCN creates a sort of \"summary\" of the sequence that describes, in a sequence of 768 dimensional vectors, the \"feeling\" of the input. During training, the NCN randomly (ok it's not really random, it's end-to-end gradient modulation) turns the knobs of attention/temperature, layer gain, and FF gating up and down, and sees how these three stats affect the loss. Over millions of sequences, it implicitly learns which set of values for each knob produces the lowest loss for each \"feeling.\"\n\nOnce the LLM and NCN are fully trained, the NCN can then modulate the LLM's outputs. For a simplified example, let's say a user asked the LLM to solve a math question. The NCN may detect the \"math\" feeling and lower temperature to encourage fact recall and discourage creativity. Likewise, asking the LLM to write a poem may result in the NCN increasing temperature for more creative output.\n\nWe haven't updated the paper yet on this topic, but we also recently made the \"feel\" the NCN produces more flexible, allowing it to produce different values for sequences which have the same words, but in different orders. Rather than being \"tonic,\" where \"The dog chased the cat\" and \"The cat chased the dog\" would produce almost identical vector embeddings, it should now be phasic, which should allow those two sequences to have quite different embeddings.\n\nThis also reduces the risk of overfitting on contextual data. For example, a tonic, non-dynamic representation has a higher likelihood of associating all math-related sequences with a single \"feeling.\" Thus it might turn down temperature even for inputs about math that arguably should require some level of creativity, such as \"Create a new mathematical conjecture about black holes,\" or \"Unify Knot Theory and Number Theory.\"\n\nIf you'd like to read more, or read up on related work by other authors, please read the paper.\n\nIt's worth noting that this project was entirely brainstormed, built, and written by Gemini 2.5 Pro, with my guidance along the way. Gemini 3 Pro is also acknowledged for tweaking the code to produce a 12%+ increase in training speed compared to the old code, along with changing the architecture's \"feeling\" embedding from tonic to phasic representations.",

I am currently more focused on the computational aspects of machine learning (low level code for high performance computations involved in neural networks).  \nI bought the book \"linear algebra done right\" (Sheldon Axler) but ChatGPT said it is too theoretical and focused on proofs given my objectives. It suggested the book \"Trefethen & Bau — Numerical Linear Algebra\".   \nCould you please help me decide whether I should go with this advice?

The stuff I am attempting to do is Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) for Images and a regular image segmentation project. I know both of these cards arnt ideal cause SSL needs large batch size which need a lot of memory. But I am trying to manage with budget I have (for the entire desktop, I dont want to spend more than 6k AUD and there are some options in Lenova etc).\n\nWhat I want to find out is what is the main difference between the two cards, I know 5070 Ti (16GB) is much newer architecture. What I hear is the RTX 4000 Ada (20GB) is old so wanted to find out if anyone knows about it performance. I am inclined to go for 4000 Ada because of the extra 4GB VRAM.\n\nAlso if there any alternatives (better cards) please let me know.",

If you are still using the default text-embedding-3-small (1536 dims), you can likely improve your retrieval quality while slashing our Vector DB storage by **\\~66%**.  \n\n\nIn voice interfaces, latency is the enemy. We were previously using OpenAI’s text-embedding-3-small (1536 dimensions), but we recently migrated to **Voyage 3.5 Lite** truncated to **512 dimensions**.\n\nThe results were immediate and measurable.\n\n# The Impact on [MyClone.is](http://MyClone.is) \n\nBy reducing the dimensionality from 1536 to 512, we saw massive speed gains in the retrieval step without sacrificing accuracy:\n\n* **RAG Retrieval Latency:** Reduced by **50%**. (Smaller vectors = faster cosine similarity search and lighter payload).\n* **End-to-End Voice Latency:** The total time from \"user speaks\" to \"AI responds\" dropped by **15%**.\n\nFor anyone building real-time RAG (especially Voice), I highly recommend testing this. That 15% shaved off the total turnaround time makes the conversation feel much more natural.\n\nHas anyone else experimented with sub-768-dimension embeddings for low-latency apps?\n\n  \n\n\n",

Now assuming that these are cores and their probabilities can be controlled then can't we use each core as a neuron that activates or doesn't activate by determining a value such as 0.571 to calculate the neccasary voltage required to simulate a 57.1% chance for activation within the TSU core?\n\nNow if we do this Back propagation becomes an issue, but what if we ditch it completely? What if we use [Predictive Coding](https://youtu.be/l-OLgbdZ3kk?si=KpxCSq9gXXwWGBsZ&t=426) algorithm which will be continiously trained on this hardware. In short: the predictive coding algorithm is basically Layer1 predicting Layer2 which the errors for Layer1 is stored at Layer2. Due to its simplicity and the efficiency of the hardware it can be run in real time.\n\nNow the memory will be an issue, but that's why we continously train the model to update the neurons to the current task by feeding the relavant information from memory. That way the Neural network continiously learns and adapts to new tasks with little energy in real time.\n\nI believe that if the TSU is a success, then this method could be used to generate a step towards AGI.",
